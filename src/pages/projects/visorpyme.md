## About the experience

This was my first project using Javascript and also my first team project. I started with literally 0 knowledge of Javascript frameworks but by the end I think I managed to get quite a bit of experience with the ins and outs of Express.js.

Coming from Rails, it was a world of a difference. Rails holds your hand by giving you a very opinionated way of doing things and provides a very stable foundation to build your project on. Express.js on the other hand? Here, this is app.js go build your project and here's the npm registry grab what you need have fun ðŸ˜›.

At the start we were many people working on the project, each one with clearly defined tasks, but as time went on we slowly started losing team members and I ended up working on pretty much all aspects of the project's back-end (or at least learning how they work), even some things that aren't coding related like deploying a staging server for testing or later on deploying and configuring the application in a production server, with domain names and everything.

Since this was a complex project with multiple teams working on it, I got to share ideas with people that had different experiences and backgrounds than mine. We had to communicate with the front-end team to make sure they can connect properly with the back-end, we had to discuss with the stakeholder and product owner about which features they want and if they were feasible to implement in the time we had and we could even share our opinions about the website design with the UX/UI team despite our team having nothing to do with it.

All in all, this was a great experience. I got to meet and work with people of different backgrounds and skills and I learned a lot in the process.
