## Welcome!

As the description says, this is a small website to showcase the projects I've worked on.

I'm not exactly a CSS or UI expert so I decided to keep it simple with Pico CSS and small amounts of CSS here and there to make the website look the way I want to.

As for the framework, I chose Astro because after a little bit of research it seemed like the option that best fit my needs. It's light and fast while also having access to integrations in case I want to build something more complex on top of it.

## To do list

- Add a tag system to sort entries
- Add a light and dark mode toggle
- Implement i18n and a spanish version of the website
